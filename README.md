# Kafka-to-Prometheus

## Overview

This project leverages an application that exposes a Prometheus endpoint to scrap metrics in a Kafka topic. The main use case is integrating metrics streamed in topic by IBM Cloud monitoring to enterprise monitoring systems, like Dynatrace or Instana. Below the diagram with the flow of actions:
